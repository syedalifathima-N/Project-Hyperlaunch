ðŸš¢ Titanic Fare Prediction - Project Overview
ðŸ“¦ Source:
->The Titanic dataset comes from the tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912.
->It is available in many ML libraries like Seaborn, Kaggle, and Scikit-learn.

 ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:
->To predict survival of passengers based on personal and travel details.
->Itâ€™s great for learning classification, regression, and data preprocessing.

column	Type	Description:
*survived	Binary (0/1)	Target variable: 1 = Survived, 0 = Did not survive
*pclass	Categorical	Passenger class: 1 = Upper, 2 = Middle, 3 = Lower
*sex	Categorical	Gender of the passenger
*age	Numeric	Age in years
*sibsp	Numeric	# of siblings/spouses aboard
*parch	Numeric	# of parents/children aboard
*fare	Numeric	Ticket fare paid
*embarked	Categorical	Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
*class	Categorical	Class name (redundant with pclass)
*who	Categorical	man, woman, child
*deck	Categorical	Cabin deck (A to G, some missing)
*embark_town	Categorical	Name of embarkation town
*alone	Boolean	Whether passenger was alone.

ðŸ§  Common Uses in ML:
->Classification: Predict survived (yes/no)
->Regression: Predict fare, age, etc.
->EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Age distribution, survival by class, gender-based survival
->Feature Engineering: Convert categorical data, handle missing values, etc.


ðŸ”Ž Dataset Size:
->Rows: ~891 passengers (depending on version)
->columns: ~10 features

ðŸ§  Logistic Regression â€“ Titanic Survival Prediction
âœ… Goal:
->Use features like age, sex, and pclass to predict if a passenger survived (1) or not (0).

ðŸ“ˆ Output Youâ€™ll See:
->Accuracy: Overall model performance
->Confusion Matrix: True/False predictions
->Classification Report:
->Precision: Correct positive predictions
->Recall: Model's ability to find all positives
->F1-score: Balance between precision and recall

âœ… Example Use Case:
->Predict whether a 30-year-old female in 2nd class would survive the Titanic.
